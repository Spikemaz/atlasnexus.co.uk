## 6. Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Command
```python
from canary_rollout import emergency_rollback
result = emergency_rollback()
# Result: {'input_hierarchy_processor': True, 'reverse_dscr_engine': True, ...}
```

### Individual Feature Rollback
```python
from feature_flags import feature_flags
feature_flags.rollback_feature('input_hierarchy_processor')
```

### Manual Phase Rollback
```python
from canary_rollout import canary_manager
canary_manager.manual_advance_feature('reverse_dscr_engine')  # Advance
canary_manager._rollback_feature('reverse_dscr_engine', 'manual_intervention')  # Rollback
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)
1. Feature flags automatically disable new code paths
2. Existing data remains unchanged (no destructive migrations)
3. New schemas are additive only
4. MongoDB collections unaffected by feature rollbacks

## 8. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Components
1. **Reverse DSCR Engine**: Complex financial calculations
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive unit tests, admin-only initially
   - **Rollback**: Instant via feature flag disable

2. **Input Hierarchy Processor**: New data processing pipeline
   - **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout, extensive logging
   - **Rollback**: Automatic on error threshold breach

3. **Viability Tiering**: Business logic changes
   - **Mitigation**: Shadow mode testing, admin validation
   - **Rollback**: Feature flag controls all exposure

### Medium-Risk Components
1. **Repository Eligibility**: Jurisdiction-specific rules
   - **Mitigation**: Rule table validation, audit logging
   - **Rollback**: Rule-by-rule disable capability

2. **Enhanced Security**: New rate limiting
   - **Mitigation**: Conservative thresholds initially
   - **Rollback**: Revert to previous limits

### Low-Risk Components
1. **Observability**: Metrics and logging
   - **Mitigation**: No business logic impact
   - **Rollback**: Can disable without affecting functionality

2. **Feature Flags**: Management system
   - **Mitigation**: Self-contained, well-tested
   - **Rollback**: Manual intervention available
