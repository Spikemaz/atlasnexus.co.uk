## 🔒 Security & Safety Measures

### Feature Flag Protection
```
ALL Phase-1 features are DISABLED by default:
├─ input_hierarchy_processor: DISABLED (admin-only, 0% rollout)
├─ reverse_dscr_engine: DISABLED (admin-only, 0% rollout)
├─ repo_eligibility_rules: DISABLED (admin-only, 0% rollout)
├─ viability_tiering: DISABLED (admin-only, 0% rollout)
└─ dashboard_tiles: DISABLED (admin-only, 0% rollout)

ENABLED safety features:
├─ enhanced_rate_limiting: ENABLED (100% rollout)
├─ input_validation_v2: ENABLED (100% rollout)
├─ cors_security: ENABLED (100% rollout)
├─ enhanced_logging: ENABLED (admin-only, 100% rollout)
└─ performance_metrics: ENABLED (admin-only, 100% rollout)
```

### Rollback Procedures
```
Level 1: Individual feature rollback
  → feature_flags.rollback_feature('feature_name')

Level 2: Emergency rollback all Phase-1
  → emergency_rollback()  # API: POST /api/phase1/rollout/emergency-rollback

Level 3: Complete system rollback
  → Git revert to commit f42638c94d89fa84b3d9e50654e046b91869392f
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Admin Actions Required)

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Admin Testing** - Test all Phase-1 features via admin panel
2. **Monitor Logs** - Check `/tmp/app_structured.log` for any issues
3. **Verify Metrics** - Confirm all counters are incrementing correctly

### Day 1-2 (Admin-Only Phase)
1. **Feature Validation** - Test each Phase-1 component thoroughly
2. **Performance Baseline** - Establish performance baselines
3. **Security Verification** - Confirm enhanced security is working

### Day 3+ (Canary Rollout)
1. **Start 1% Rollout** - POST `/api/phase1/rollout/start` when ready
2. **Monitor Progression** - GET `/api/phase1/rollout/check` for health
3. **Scale Up** - Progress through 1% → 25% → 100% based on metrics

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

### If Issues Detected
```bash
# 1. Check system health
curl https://atlasnexus.co.uk/health

# 2. View real-time logs
tail -f /tmp/app_structured.log

# 3. Check feature flag status
GET /api/phase1/dashboard (admin only)

# 4. Emergency rollback if needed
POST /api/phase1/rollout/emergency-rollback (admin only)
```
